#### Reference

The reference we use here (`Ath_plus_Har.fa`) is a concatenation of the TAIR10
and HaR527-3 genomes. TAIR10 was taken from the omnidopsis references dir, and
so contains the non-ACGTN fix. HaR527-3 is from Gautam's work.

I changed the contig names to be `Ath_chr#` or `Har_chr#` to make it clear
which genome the contig belongs to.
